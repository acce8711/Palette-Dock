add page

auto generate laoding spinner does not smoothly go back to its orginal position
text input field changes colour on hover
plus should be centered

just say "share your colour palette with others"

say "clear" instead of delete
delete button exapnds content onhover. i don't like that

colour modal shpould probably have a button

when user adds palette
-improve text
-equal padding between ettx and palette
-close button

View all
like button text should also change olour on hover
 copy button maybe shouldnt be inside of box
also make the border radius for it smaller
dropdown-more padding for drowpdown icon
sticky dropdown header or option to go back up


general
tooltip for each tab to let the user know whats up
add underline for wech tab (maybe folder style)
topleft icon should lead somewhere on click
cosnider adding skelton ui

tuto - drag and drop
